```
`Secure variable storage` is available only in Terraform Enterprise or Cloud workspaces and not in Terraform CLI.

Terraform Enterprise and Cloud workspaces provide additional features and functionality beyond what is available
in the open-source Terraform CLI. One of these features is the ability to store sensitive data, such as API keys
or passwords, securely within a workspace. This allows teams to share infrastructure code without exposing
sensitive information
