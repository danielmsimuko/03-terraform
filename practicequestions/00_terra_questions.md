### Understand infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts

1. The terraform.tfstate file always matches your currently built infrastructure (t or f)
```
f. tfstate primarily looks at the state of current configuration and what you are now declaring in the main.tf. 
it will then decide to add/change/delete accordingly
```

2. One remote backend configuration always maps to a single remote workspace. (t or f)
```
f. terraform remote backend can work with either a single remote cloud workspace or multiple
similarly named remote spaces 
```

3. How is terraform remote backend different than other state backends such as S3, consul?
```
a. the remote backend can runs on dedicated infrastructure on premises or in 
terraform cloud
```

4. What is the workflow for deploying new infrastructure with Terraform?
```
Write terraform config file
run terraform fmt to format file syntax 
run terraform init to initialise
run terraform validate to look for syntax error
run terraform plan to plan changes
terraform apply to create new infra
```

5. a provider configuration block is required in every terraform configuration. A = yes

```
provider "provider_name" {
  features {
      etc...
  }
}

Terraform configurations must declare which providers they require so that Terraform can install and use them.
```

6. You run a local-exec provisioner in a null resource called null_resource.run_script and realize that you need to rerun the script. Which of the following commands would you use first?
```
terraform apply -replace="null_resource.run_script"
```

7. Which provisioner invokes a process on the resource created by Terraform?
```
remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it has been created
```

8. What command does Terraform require the first time you run it within a configuration directory?

```
terraform init --- used to intialise the working directory containing terraform
configuration files
```

9. Terraform providers can: ?
```
A. be written by individuals and maintained by a community of users 
B. major cloud vendors an non-cloud vendors can write, maintain, or collaborate on terraform providers
```

10. You have deployed a new webapp with a public IP address on a cloud provider. However, you did not create any outputs for your code.

What is the best method to quickly find the IP address of the resource you deployed?

```
Run terraform state list to find the name of the resource, then terraform state show to find the attributes including public IP address
```
